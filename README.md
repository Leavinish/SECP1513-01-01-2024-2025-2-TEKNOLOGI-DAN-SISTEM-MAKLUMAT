ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Technology Information System
Technology Information System (TIS) is a combination of people, hardware, software, data, and processes that work together to collect, store, manage, and share information. It plays a key role in helping organizations make better decisions, improve efficiency, and solve problems using technology. In todayâ€™s digital world, TIS is used in almost every field, including business, education, healthcare, and government.

TOPIC I HAVE LEARN THIS SEMESTER: 
Chapter 1: Emerging Technology in ICT
This chapter introduces new and trending technologies in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Blockchain. These technologies are changing how people work, communicate, and solve problems in many industries.

Chapter 2: Computer Hardware
You learned about the physical parts of a computer, including the system unit (CPU, RAM, motherboard) and input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer). The chapter also covers secondary storage like hard drives and SSDs, and explains how hardware has evolved over time.

Chapter 3: Software
This chapter covers the types of software: system software (like operating systems) and application software (like Microsoft Word or Excel). It also explains how software helps users and hardware work together to perform tasks.

Chapter 4: Information System and SAD (System Analysis and Design)
You learned how information systems collect, process, store, and share data to support decision-making. The chapter also introduces System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a step-by-step method for designing and building new systems.

Chapter 5: Databases and Data Analytics
This chapter explains how data is stored in databases, managed using Database Management Systems (DBMS), and analyzed to find useful insights. Topics include data types, data models, and data analytics tools used in business.

Chapter 6: Privacy and Ethics
You explored how personal data should be protected and used responsibly. The chapter discusses ethical issues in using technology, like data misuse, cybercrime, and the importance of following privacy laws and guidelines.
