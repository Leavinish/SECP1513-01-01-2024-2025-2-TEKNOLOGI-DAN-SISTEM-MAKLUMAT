## 💡 Introduction to Technology and Information System (TIS)

Technology Information System (TIS) is a combination of people, hardware, software, data, and processes that work together to collect, store, manage, and share information. It plays a key role in helping organizations make better decisions, improve efficiency, and solve problems using technology.

In today’s digital world, TIS is used in almost every field — including business, education, healthcare, and government.
